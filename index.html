  <h6>About Me</h6>
  <p>I am a 24 year old data analyst, looking to explore a career in programming and web development. I graduated from the University of Portland in 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. After graduation, I worked as an account manager at a digital advertising agency called Adpearance. After a few months, I transitioned to an operations coordinator at a software company called Inavero. I still work at Inavero (now called Clearly Rated), but since september 2018, I have been working as a data analyst.</p>
  <p>I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, but moved down to Portland for college and stayed around after graduation. I currently live in St. Johns with two of my friends from college. In our free time we watch a lot of sports and drink a lot of beer. I was the fantasy football champion in our friends league this year.</p>
